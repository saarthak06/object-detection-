# 🧠 Object Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on CIFAR-10

This project implements an image classification model using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. It is developed as part of an AI/ML internship at **Adunit Foundation** and demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline — from dataset loading and model building to training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📌 Project Objective

To accurately detect and classify images into 10 object categories (e.g., airplane, car, bird, etc.) using a deep learning model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
